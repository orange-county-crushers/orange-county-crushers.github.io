      <h2>Coaching Philosophy</h2>
    </header>
  <p>
  The Crushers use a paid professional baseball coach for all team practices to teach consistent and correct baseball fundamentals. Practices focus on team baseball and develop advanced skills needed for Middle School and High School Baseball. The Professional Coach also works on an individual player development plan for every team member to help the player reach their goals. 
  </p><p>
  Weekend Tournaments are managed by Parent Coaches who reinforce the team and individual techniques taught in practices. Attendance at all team practices is mandatory for our organization so expert team skills can be developed by all players.
